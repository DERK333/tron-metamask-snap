NPM Login Instructions
=====================

To publish your package, you need to log in to npm first.

1. Run this command:
   npm login

2. You'll be prompted for:
   - Username: (your npm username)
   - Password: (your npm password)
   - Email: (your npm email)
   - One-time password: (if you have 2FA enabled)

3. After successful login, run:
   npm whoami
   
   This should show your npm username.

4. Then publish with your OTP:
   npm publish --otp=YOUR_6_DIGIT_CODE

Note: The OTP code changes every 30 seconds, so you'll need a fresh code when publishing.
