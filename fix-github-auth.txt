Fix GitHub Authentication Issue
==============================

The error shows "DERK333" (uppercase) trying to push to "Derk333" (mixed case).

Solution: Use the correct username with your Personal Access Token

1. First, create a Personal Access Token on GitHub:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
   - Name: "Replit Push Token"
   - Select scope: "repo" (full control of private repositories)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - COPY THE TOKEN (you won't see it again!)

2. Update your git remote with the correct username:
   git remote set-url origin https://Derk333@github.com/Derk333/tron-metamask-snap.git

3. Push your code:
   git push -u origin main

4. When prompted for password, paste your Personal Access Token (not your GitHub password)

Alternative: If the username still causes issues, use the token directly:
   git remote set-url origin https://[YOUR-TOKEN]@github.com/Derk333/tron-metamask-snap.git
   git push -u origin main

Important: Make sure you use "Derk333" (exact case) not "DERK333"
