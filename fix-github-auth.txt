# GitHub Push Issue - Token Security

The push is being blocked because your GitHub personal access token is exposed in the files:
- merge-and-push.sh
- sync-github.sh  
- attached_assets/Pasted--workspace-git-push-https...txt

GitHub's security system detected this and is protecting your account.

## Solution Steps:

1. First, remove the files with exposed tokens from git history:
   git rm merge-and-push.sh sync-github.sh
   git rm attached_assets/Pasted--workspace-git-push-https-DERK333-ghp-Psc1d9JN0TMbuVG7KNSQyyL7Gs4I0527qDyk-github-com-DERK333-tr-1751143548436_1751143548437.txt
   git commit -m "Remove files with exposed tokens"

2. Create a new personal access token on GitHub:
   - Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
   - Generate a new token with 'repo' permissions
   - Save it securely (don't commit it to the repo!)

3. Use the new token to push:
   git push https://DERK333:[NEW_TOKEN]@github.com/DERK333/tron-metamask-snap.git main

4. After successful push, revoke the old exposed token:
   Token ending in: 7qDyk

Important: Never commit access tokens to your repository!
