# Publishing to GitHub - Complete Guide

## Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

Since you're getting authentication errors, you need to use a GitHub token:

### Option A: Quick Push with Token
```bash
git push https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/DERK333/tron-metamask-snap.git main
```

### Option B: Set Up Permanent Authentication
```bash
# Set the remote URL with your token
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/DERK333/tron-metamask-snap.git

# Then push normally
git push origin main
```

### How to Get a GitHub Token:
1. Go to GitHub.com and log in
2. Click your profile picture ‚Üí Settings
3. Scroll down to "Developer settings" on the left
4. Click "Personal access tokens" ‚Üí "Tokens (classic)"
5. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
6. Give it a name like "Replit Push"
7. Check the "repo" checkbox (this gives full repository access)
8. Click "Generate token" at the bottom
9. COPY THE TOKEN NOW - you won't see it again!
